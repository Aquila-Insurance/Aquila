# Aquila-Deployed-Prototype
The frontend for Aquila's Parametric Forest Fire Insurance dApp was built with create-react-app, react-moralis, and moralis. Moralis was key to building the dApp quickly, 
providing methods to authenticate the user, to store the user's property coodinates in the database, and to complete payment of the insurance premium. 

The designs for the frontend were made in Adobe Illustrator and Figma. View designs in Figma here:
